Godfrey# Exit swirl and return to the R prompt (>) at any time by pressing the Esc key
# If you are already at the prompt, type bye() to exit and save your progress.

# When you are at the R prompt (>):
# Typing skip() allows you to skip the current question.
# Typing play() lets you experiment with R on your own; swirl will ignore what you do...
# UNTIL you type nxt() which will regain swirl's attention.
# Typing bye() causes swirl to exit. Your progress will be saved.
# Typing main() returns you to swirl's main menu.
# Typing info() displays these options again.

# To begin, you must install a course. I can install a course for you from the internet, or I can send you to a web page
# (https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses) which will provide course options and directions for installing courses yourself.
# (If you are not connected to the internet, type 0 to exit.)

# If at any point you'd like more information on a particular topic related to R, you can type help.start() at the prompt, which
# will open a menu of resources (either within RStudio or your default web browser, depending on your setup). Alternatively, a
# simple web search often yields the answer you're looking for.
